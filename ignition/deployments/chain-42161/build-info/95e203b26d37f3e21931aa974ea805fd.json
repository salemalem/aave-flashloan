The key concept here is that Aave's flash loan system follows a callback pattern:      - When a flash loan is requested via `flashLoanSimple()`, Aave's smart contract        transfers the requested amount to the borrower (this contract).      - Immediately after transferring the funds, Aave **automatically** calls the        `executeOperation()` function on the borrower contract.      - The `executeOperation()` function must implement the logic to utilize the        borrowed funds and ensure that the loan (plus fees) is repaid **within the same transaction**.      This mechanism works because our contract **implements the IFlashLoanSimpleReceiver interface**,      which includes the `executeOperation()` function signature.      Aave expects this function to exist in any contract that requests a flash loan.      If `executeOperation()` is not implemented or fails, the entire transaction is reverted.
